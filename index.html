                    <h2>Ring of Fire over Monument Valley</h2>
                    <p>Tracking along a narrow path, the shadow of a new moon will race across North, Central, and South
                        America, on October 14. When viewed from the shadow path the apparent size of the lunar disk
                        will not quite completely cover the Sun though. Instead, the moon in silhouette will appear
                        during the minutes of totality surrounded by a fiery ring, an annular solar eclipse more
                        dramatically known as a ring of fire eclipse. This striking time lapse sequence from May of 2012
                        illustrates the stages of a ring of fire eclipse. From before eclipse start until sunset, they
                        are seen over the iconic buttes of planet Earth's Monument Valley. Remarkably, the October 14
                        ring of fire eclipse will also be visible over Monument Valley, beginning after sunrise in the
                        eastern sky.</p>

                    <h2>IC 2118: The Witch Head Nebula</h2>
                    <p>Does this nebula look like the head of a witch? The nebula is known popularly as the Witch Head
                        Nebula because, it is said, the nebula's shape resembles a Halloween-style caricature of a
                        witch's head. Exactly how, though, can be a topic of imaginative speculation. What is clear is
                        that IC 2118 is about 50 light-years across and made of gas and dust that points to -- because
                        it has been partly eroded by -- the nearby star Rigel. One of the brighter stars in the
                        constellation Orion, Rigel lies below the bottom of the featured image. The blue color of the
                        Witch Head Nebula and is caused not only by Rigel's intense blue starlight but because the dust
                        grains scatter blue light more efficiently than red. The same physical process causes Earth's
                        daytime sky to appear blue, although the scatterers in planet Earth's atmosphere are molecules
                        of nitrogen and oxygen.</p>

                    <h2>MyCn 18: The Engraved Hourglass Planetary Nebula</h2>
                    <p>Do you see the hourglass shape -- or does it see you? If you can picture it, the rings of MyCn 18
                        trace the outline of an hourglass -- although one with an unusual eye in its center. Either way,
                        the
                        sands of time are running out for the central star of this hourglass-shaped planetary nebula.
                        With
                        its nuclear fuel exhausted, this brief, spectacular, closing phase of a Sun-like star's life
                        occurs
                        as its outer layers are ejected - its core becoming a cooling, fading white dwarf. In 1995,
                        astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to make a series of images of planetary
                        nebulae,
                        including the one featured here. Pictured, delicate rings of colorful glowing gas (nitrogen-red,
                        hydrogen-green, and oxygen-blue) outline the tenuous walls of the hourglass. The unprecedented
                        sharpness of the Hubble images has revealed surprising details of the nebula ejection process
                        that
                        are helping to resolve the outstanding mysteries of the complex shapes and symmetries of
                        planetary
                        nebulas like MyCn 18.</p>
